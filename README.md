# STATS471: Data Science and Analytics with Python

This is my STATS471 Data Science and Analytics project repository! This repository contains the code, notebooks, and lab assignments from UM-SJTU JI's Data Science and Analytics course (STATS471), which I took to gain hands-on experience with data analysis and analytics using Python.

### About Honor Code

This repository contains the code, notebooks, and assignments that I have completed as part of my STATS471 course. Copying code directly from this repository is a violation of the academic honor code. Please do not use these materials to submit as your own work. 

## Course Overview

STATS471 is designed to provide a foundation in data science techniques and methodologies, focusing on:
- Data cleaning and manipulation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing
- Data visualization
- Machine learning algorithms
- Using Python for data science applications

## Contents

This repository includes the following:

- **Lab Assignments**: Python code and Jupyter Notebooks from each lab session.
- **House Price Prediction Project**: A final project in which I applied the concepts learned throughout the course to a real dataset, including data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and model building.
- **Data Files**: Datasets used in the labs and project.
